# Scientific Calculator in C#

This scientific calculator is a project developed in C# that combines the use of grammars, parsers, and native C# functionalities. Initially, grammars and parsers were developed to interpret and process mathematical expressions. Subsequently, the calculation logic was implemented using the C# language.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Advanced operations (powers, roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.)
- Handling complex expressions with nested parentheses
- History of performed calculations
- Intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)
